**Running the Code:** Use the "make" command then run the driver code, chash.c, inputting all commands into the file command.txt.


**AI Use:** We used AI to properly understand the use of lock specific methods such as pthread_rwlock_unlock(&rwlock), including when and how they should be integrated into the code. Furthermore, some of our group members were unfamiliar with the usage of the makefile, so we asked ChatGPT to walk us through setting up the file hierarchy in the repository.
